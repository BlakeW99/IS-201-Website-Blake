    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I was born May 13, 1999 in Middle Georgia. When I was born, I was diagnosed with Complex Conginital Heart Disease. This diagnosis included a Single Ventricle Heart, Severe Pulmonary Stenosis, Atrial Septal Defects, Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation, and a complete heart block, among other things. The doctors did not expect me to live long, and my heart conditions required three surgeries, including open-heart surgery. Though they fixed the heart blockage and a few other minor issues, my medical problems persist. As I grew up I was told that this would be a limiting factor in the things which I could accomplish; however, while I have seen its affects, I have not been stopped from accomplishing anything I wanted to do. </p>
    <p> Growing up, I participated in several extra-curricular activites both at school, and outside of school. Music was a major part of my in-school extracurricular activities. I began learning to play the piano around 2007 and continued to play the piano until around 2013. When I started middle school, I also joined the band program as a percussionist. I stayed in band throughout my time in middle school and continued to participate in the band once I enrolled in my high school. In high school, I joined the marching band as a front ensemble member, where I spent all four years of my high school career. During my last two years in the marching band, I was assigned to be one of the section leaders for the front ensemble. This meant that I was in charge of organizing the section and leading practices for the section. Along with the marching band, I also participated in high school activities in other ways. Despite not being physically capable of playing on any high school sports team, I could still participate in other non-playing positions. Thanks to my connections with the head coach of the basketball team, I was able to join the basketball team as a team manager, which meant I helped with practices and logistics. I participated in this position through all four years of high school. While the marching band took up most of my time from July to November, Basketball helped fill the months of December to April so I could actively participate throughout the school year.</p>
    <p>Outside of school the Boy Scouts of America made up another large chunk of my activities. I was very active within my church's scouting branch and worked hard to complete merit badges and rank advancements requirements. Accomplishing this was not easy, as many parts of the scouting program required physical exertion, such as the required Physical Fitness merit badge, camping trips, and swimming requirements for rank advancements. The BSA offered me the ability to complete alternative requirements due to my medical conditions, but I did not take them. Instead, I worked to build the stamina I needed to meet the requirements necessary for my advancements. In 2015, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank within the Boy Scouts of America.</p>
    <p>Around the time I turned 18, I went on a mission trip for my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My doctors were concerned it would not be a good decision for me to go on. Because of the strenuous physical activities missionaries go through; they were unsure that I would have the medical ability to accomplish it. Despite this, my desire to go led to me submitting my mission application papers. Thanks to the accommodations made by the church in my assignment, I was able to serve a unique online mission that gave me the ability to talk to people from all sorts of backgrounds all around the world. I most recently, have finished college at Brigham Young Universiy and obtained a Bachelors in Political Science. Along with this I obtained minors in communications, and in political research and data analysis. I am currently seeking to attend a graduate program in order to obtain a Masters of Public Policy. </p>
